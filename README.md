Trippy image zoom using PixiJS and GreenSock. 

Images are from OZORA Music Festival. There are 11 sets of images, with 3 images in each set, and look like this.

The images are scaled from 1 to 2, and staggered with a delay. The smaller the delay, the better the quality of the scaling, but at the cost of more draw calls.
